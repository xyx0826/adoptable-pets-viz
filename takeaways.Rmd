## Conclusions.

We hope you've enjoyed the cat pictures.
This dataset provides a snapshot of the animal adoption -
and abandonment - landscape.

First, among the various kinds of pets, such as dogs, cats, rabbits,
birds, etc, the largest number of the sheltered animals in the dataset
of Montgomery County is cats.
Secondly, in terms of the specific breeds, domestic shorthair cats and
pitbulls are the most sheltered pets.

Giving a pet a home is a huge responsibility, yet sadly a lot of people
do not take it seriously.
It seems like Montgomery County is performing quite well
in terms of pet adoption - the county has over a million residents
according to US Census, but with merely eighty pets for adoption.
However, in the United States according to ASPCA, about **6.5 million**
pet animals enter animal shelters every year, where **23%** of them
are eventually euthanized.
