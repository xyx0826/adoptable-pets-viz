## Conclusions.

We hope you've enjoyed the cat pictures.
This dataset provides a snapshot of the animal adoption -
and abandonment - landscape.

First, among the various kinds of pets, such as dogs, cats, rabbits,
birds, etc, the largest number of the sheltered animals in the dataset
of Montgomery County is cats.
Secondly, in terms of the specific breeds, domestic shorthair cats and
pitbulls are the most sheltered pets.

The dataset is published by Montgomery County Animal Services, and is said to update every two hours. However, the last update occurred in December of 2020, so there is the issue of how up to date the dataset is. The dataset is also restricted to a single county and contains only 80 rows. Therefore statistical analysis from this dataset might not be very conclusive. We donâ€™t expect the dataset to cause any ethical issues, though it may affect how potential pet owners choose their pet to adopt, since pets that have already been adopted may still show in the dataset and newly available adoptable pets will not show up in the dataset. General analysis of this dataset may also provide information to pet shelters on how to better allocate resources for different types of animals. 

In the future, we can consider analyzing data about adoptable animals from a larger dataset entailing nation-wide adoboptable pets rather than just from a single county. 

Giving a pet a home is a huge responsibility, yet sadly a lot of people
do not take it seriously.
It seems like Montgomery County is performing quite well
in terms of pet adoption - the county has over a million residents
according to US Census, but with merely eighty pets for adoption.
However, in the United States according to ASPCA, about **6.5 million**
pet animals enter animal shelters every year, where **23%** of them
are eventually euthanized.
