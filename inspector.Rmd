Here is an opportunity to browser all kinds of pets through the table. 
You may search the **key word**, which includes the breed, animal type (eg.dog,
cat), intake time, pet name, color, etc. 
By searching key work, the table would automatically filter the eligible pets.

After selecting a specific pet, an associated picture would display on the top of the table. 
You may also see your selected pet's **location** and **age** distribution among
all of the pets through the charts. For the **location** map, the x-axis is
the longitude, and the y-axis is the latitude. The red dot showed the specific
location of the pet. The chart right next to the map displayed the **age**
distribution of the pet. You may see clearly how the selected pet's age
distributed among the all through the orientated red dot.
