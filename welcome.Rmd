## Hi there.

**Welcome to Montgomery Pets!**
On this site, you can look through a list of adoptable animals
reported by Montgomery County Animals Services in Maryland.

This site provides you a way to explore and discover
what characteristics of te pets are more likely to be
found for adoption - or abandoned - in Montgomery County.

Please be aware that the size of the dataset is limited,
as it comes from a single county.
It might not be representative of other places or the whole country.

## Technical details.

This [dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/adoptable-pets)
is provided on data.gov in a CSV format.

Multiple libraries are used in the processing and delivery of this
dataset:

- `DT`, for fancy data tables
- `hash`, for easier data cleaning
- and `tidyverse`, for all data processing and plotting needs

We hope you enjoy your stay.
